/**
 This class implements a simplified game engine that consists of a 2D physics
 engine and a rendering engine. Any object that has been registered in the game
 engine will be managed by the game engine from then on, until it is deregistered
 from the engine.

 All objects registered in the game engine are called `GameObject`s. You should
 register each `GameObject` with only one game engine.
