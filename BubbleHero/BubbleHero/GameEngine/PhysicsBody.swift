/**
 `PhysicsBody` defines some basic physical properties that objects managed by
 the physics engine should minimally satisfy:

 1. The object is modelled as a perfect circle. Thus, all `PhysicsBody`s have
 the same shape.
 2. Each object has its own independent position, velocity and acceleration.
 The position is referred as the center of the circle.
 3. The object can optionally be a rigid body. Collision can only happen between
 two rigid bodies.
