/**
 Each object registered in the `PhysicsEngine` must be a `GameObject`. A
 `GameObject` can either be static or be moving.

 For simplicity, a `GameObject` is modelled as a 2D perfect circle, with a
 constant area, but without volume or mass.

 To display a `GameObject`, it should be associated with a `UIView` object.
 Although the `UIView` object may not be visually shown as a perfect circle,
 its shape will not be taken into consideration. However, the content of its
 `frame` will be changed such that the movement of the `GameObject` can be
 observed by the user.

 Notice that the speed and acceleration of a `GameObject` is modelled as a
 `CGVector`, whose `dx` and `dy` will correspond to its speed/acceleration on
 the x/y axis. The speed/acceleration here is in the unit of a frame, i.e.,
 the change in location/speed per display link's frame. By default, `CADisplayLink`'s
 frame rate is 60 frames per second.
