/**
 `Level` is an abstract data structure that represents a certain game level,
 i.e., the initial placement of all bubbles.

 Internally, `Level` uses a 2D array to store all bubbles with their positions
 inside the grid. The elements of this 2D array are of type `BubbleType?`. In other
 words, if an item in this array is `nil`, it implies there is no bubble at this
 position. If it is not `nil`, that means there is a bubble with at this position,
 and the `BubbleType` of this bubble is the value of this item in the array.

 The grid (2D array) has different number of items on odd/even rows. Odd rows
 should have one fewer item than even rows.
