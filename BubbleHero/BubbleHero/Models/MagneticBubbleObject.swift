/**
 `MagneticBubbleObject` is a special kind of bubble that is magnetic. A magnetic
 bubble will atract other moving objects, of which the attraction force between
 then is proportional to the square of distance between them. However, notice the
 objects here do not obey Newton's 2nd Law.

 In the imaginary world, attraction force is single-way. In other words, the magnetic
 body will not move. It will only instruct other objects being attracted to move.
 This violates Newton's 3rd Law.
